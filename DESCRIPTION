Description: Provides tools for designing and analyzing acceptance sampling plans.
    Supports both attribute-based (Binomial and Poisson) and variable-based (Normal and Beta)
    sampling, enabling quality control for fractional and compositional data.
    Uses nonlinear programming for sampling plan optimization, minimizing sample size
    while balancing producer's and consumer's risks. Operating Characteristic curves
    are available for plan visualization.
